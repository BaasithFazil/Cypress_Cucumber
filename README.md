<h2>Cypress Project with Cucumber Gherkin</h2>

<h4>Welcome to my Cypress project utilizing Cucumber Gherkin language!</h4>

<p style="font-family: 'Arial', sans-serif;">In this repository, I've implemented end-to-end testing for the Orange HRM demo website. The project structure is meticulously organized for clarity and efficiency. Feature files are conveniently located within the integration folder, nestled inside the cypress directory. For a more modular approach, action and step implementation files are neatly organized within the page objects folder. This structural design not only enhances maintainability but also significantly improves readability, making it easy for contributors to locate and extend test scenarios.</p>
